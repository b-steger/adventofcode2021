I am unsure about the solution format required by the part2 variant.
It could be the result of #'print-folded-sheet (a big collection of dots and hashes) or it could be the parsed characters (8 bytes).
I think the latter holds true. This requires, as a matter of fact, some reverse engineering. Which is probably not intended...

Writing the generators for those puzzles seems like a nice additional exercise. Some generators seem pretty simple. For example, day 8 can randomly produce a key just by shuffling the segments.
