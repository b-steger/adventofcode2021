;;;; Solution

#|
Spatial join with join condition "12 points which share the same relative positioning".

Naming conventions regarding the relative coordinate systems problem:
Any vector in relation to scanner 0, i.e. in relation to 0/0/0 with default rotation is in GLOBAL space.
 As #'grow-scanner-region at the end of this file shows, this must not be scanner 0, but typically is (depends on the input file actually).
Beacon vectors are typically in a rotated, LOCAL coordinate system. Local coordinate systems are numbered. Those numbers are called orientation-id.
|#

#|
Calculate vectors-to-other-beacons for each beacon.
Idea: all beacons in an overlapping area have the same distances towards each other. Identical beacons share identical distances.
 Think of the Voyager golden record cover image depicting the distances to our nearest pulsars, and how the distances remain the same, however this image is rotated.
The distances between the beacons within a scanner report are independent of any coordinate system rotation.

Summary
=======

This puzzle had three "plot twists":
1. Identify a similarity in a freely rotatable space through coordinate-oblivious distances (#'distances-between-beacons).
2. The position in a cross join result determines the id of both columns (#'raw-beacon-coordinates).
3. The vector to and the rotation of the right scanner need to be found separately (#'scanner-global-position and #'scanner-global-rotation).
